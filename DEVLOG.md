**Continuing my taskproject, already done with the api, now it's front end time**

- *Created a basic project structure, with some HTML,JS & CSS files.*
- *Started building a simple sidebar, to ensure a clean navigation throughout the website.*
- *Sidebar is completed; now I'll build the main content.*
- *The index page is done, as well as my chosen color palette for the application.*
- *User registration is working correctly, and the page for that is also done.*
- *User login is now complete. I had some issues with cookies, but after a code breakdown and some research, I got everything working perfectly. I also made some changes to the project structure to improve organization.*
- *User can now log out from the application, but I still need to implement redirects if they try to access certain pages, like the register and login pages. I also cannot forget to implement the reset password feature.*
